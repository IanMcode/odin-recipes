    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. chicken, beef, or pork cut into bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 lbs. vegetables, cut into bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbsp aromatics, such as garlic, ginger, or shallots</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs, such as basil or cilantro</li>
        <li>Basic Stir Fry Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>et a large wok or frying pan over medium-high heat and allow it to get screaming hot. Swirl in 2 Tablespoons of oil (1 Tablespoon if using a non-stick pan).</li>
        <li>Add your meat and cook until browned on each side (cooked thoroughly if using chicken or pork). Remove the meat from the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer the densest vegetables (i.e., those that take the longest to cook, such as carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, or bell peppers) into the pan and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add in any quick-cooking vegetables (snap peas, onions, celery, baby corn, snow peas, mushrooms, zucchini, or bok choy) and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add in any aromatics, if using. Cook for 30 seconds, moving them around the pan constantly to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the pan and pour in the sauce. Toss well to coat all of the meat and vegetables. Let cook for one minute until bubbling.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and stir in any fresh herbs, if using.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a side of cooked rice or noodles.</li>
    </ol>
